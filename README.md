# Student eLearning Resource Chatbot

This project uses a Vue.js front-end, Java back-end, REST APIs and PostgreSQL to answer and give resources for student's cirriculum-related questions. It also has the ability to randomly generate a motivational quote, return job opportunities from Github, send a transcript of the conversation to an email address or use the chatbot using SMS through implementation of external APIs.
